Diabetes Progression in Electronic Health Records


## 1.0 Teaser
The primary goal of this "mini" project is to explore the handling of electronic health records --- from data ingestion all the way through analyses. Using synthetic healthcare claims data obtained from the [Centers for Medicare & and Medicaid Services](https://data.cms.gov/collection/synthetic-medicare-enrollment-fee-for-service-claims-and-prescription-drug-event), we track beneficiaries' progression from being diagnosed with prediabetes to diabetes mellitus with/without complications. To do this, we use the assistance of AI tools for the ingestion of our data, and then proceed with statistical modeling to help us understand the dynamics involved in diabetes disease progression.
